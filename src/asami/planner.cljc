  "This is a helper function for first-group.
   When first-group has found a set of patterns that share vars with each other, this will look for
   any eval-patterns (binding through evaluation) which, if added, would allow even more patterns
   to be added to the group. So if we had:
   [?a :prop ?b] [?a :attr ?c] [(inc ?c) ?d] [(str ?b \"-\" ?d) ?e] [(dec ?c) ?f] [?x :label ?e] [?y :included true]
   Then first-group would find the first 2 patterns, which would bind: #{?a ?b ?c}

     evs = [[(inc ?c) ?d] [(str ?b \"-\" ?d) ?e] [(dec ?c) ?f]]
     bound-vars = #{?a ?b ?c}
     patterns = [[?x :label ?e] [?y :included true]]
   It will identify that [?x :label ?e] can be included if the first 2 evaluations are used,
   since they can be used to bind ?e.
   The result will be a split of the bindings that can be used to match a pattern, and the bindings which cannot:
     [ [[(inc ?c) ?d] [(str ?b \"-\" ?d) ?e]] , [[(dec ?c) ?f]] ]
   The loop in first-group will then use this result to pull in all possible patterns.

   Finds all bindings will can be used to connect unused patterns to a group.
   Returns a pair: Bindings that can be used to connect patterns to the current group / Remaining bindings
